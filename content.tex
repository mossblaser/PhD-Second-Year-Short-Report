\section{Introduction}

The human brain is the subject of intense research, a significant portion of
which relies on simulations of large-scale models of the brain. Due to the
unusual computational requirements of these simulations numerous specialised
hardware platforms have been developed to cope
\cite{furber07,moore12,maguire07,choudhary12,misra10}. This project will focus
on the interconnection networks within such systems, in particular on network
topology and power management.

Neural models of the brain typically consist of a directed graph of `neurons'
with simple, well defined behaviour and which communicate by sending `spikes'
to their neighbours. The only significant features of a spike are its origin and
time of arrival. Such models have been demonstrated to reproduce high-level
cognitive behaviours such as problem solving and memory \cite{eliasmith12}. 

Conventional super computer interconnection networks are poorly suited to human
scale models containing tens of billions of neurons \cite{williams88} each with
thousands of connections \cite{kung88}. Super computer networks are designed to
handle the transmission of large blocks of data to a limited set of
destinations. This is in sharp contrast with neural simulation where a spike may
be sent to thousands of destinations and consists only of an origin ID and
timestamp. Further, in realtime simulations timestamps may be omitted though the
maximum delivery latency must be strictly limited. Due to this mismatch,
alternative technologies are popular in neural simulators. Recent systems, such
as SpiNNaker \cite{furber07} and Bluehive \cite{moore12}, have begun to
incorporate super computer style interconnect to benefit from increased
bandwidth at the expense of power. It is here that this project hopes to
contribute to a new generation of power efficient interconnection network.

\section{SpiNNaker}

	\end{figure}
	
	SpiNNaker is a hardware platform which combines low-power mobile-phone grade
	CPU cores using a custom, high-performance interconnection network to simulate
	large networks of neurons in realtime. The largest planned machine, which is
	in the final stages of manufacturing, is designed to simulate one billion
	($10^9$) neurons in biological realtime \cite{navaridas09} and will fill ten
	server-room cabinets. Figure \ref{fig:spinnaker-abstractions} shows how over
	one million CPU cores are spread over thousands of chips and hundreds of
	circuit boards.
	
	Between chips on the same board asynchronous, parallel signalling is used with
	groups of 16 wires required to communicate data between neighbouring chips
	\cite{bainbridge02}. This technique only consumes energy when the link is in
	use. Connecting the 768 wires required between boards would be prohibitively
	expensive so a different technology, High-Speed Serial (HSS), is used
	\cite{athavale05} reducing the number of wires to 24. HSS links can support high bandwidths and in SpiNNaker, one
	board-to-board HSS link carries the load of eight asynchronous links.
	Unfortunately, HSS links consume energy at the same rate when loaded and idle;
	to reduce power the links must be operated at a lower speed.
	
	In conventional HSS applications, links change speed dynamically depending on
	load to cope with unpredictable traffic patterns \cite{infinibandta08}. Neural
	simulation traffic is also unpredictable but unfortunately, during link speed
	changes, HSS links become non-operational for around 1 ms \cite{xilinx14}. To
	maintain realtime performance in SpiNNaker, the maximum latency for a spike
	traversing the network is also around 1 ms making delays during link speed
	changes unacceptable. As a result HSS links in SpiNNaker, as in other systems,
	are operated at full speed at all times despite average network loads between
	5\% and 10\% of link capacity \cite{moore12,navaridas09}.
	
	This project will develop an improved HSS interconnect for neural simulations.
	Since SpiNNaker's HSS board-to-board links are implemented by reconfigurable
	FPGAs the platform lends itself to a prototype implementation.

\section{Preliminary work}
	
	Work has initially focused on developing improvements to existing neural
	interconnection networks and building infrastructure to enable their
	implementation within SpiNNaker.
	
	\subsection{SpiNNaker interconnect modelling}
		
		A detailed simulation model of SpiNNaker's interconnect was developed and
		compared with SpiNNaker hardware as part of a collaborative work exploring
		novel hardware-accelerated modelling of computer architectures. The result
		demonstrated a strong correspondence between the simulator and SpiNNaker
		indicating its suitability for use in the development of improvements to
		SpiNNaker's interconnect. This work is being prepared for journal submission
		in early September. This simulator will be exploited in upcoming work.
	
	\subsection{Wiring large systems with small-world connectivity}

			network wrap-around to connect to those on the other side. Actual networks
			are much larger.}
			\label{fig:spinn-topology}
		\end{figure}
		
		HSS technology imposes constraints on the lengths of wires used in large
		systems; for example in SpiNNaker, wires are limited to 1 metre or less
		\cite{sata3spec}. SpiNNaker's network uses a 2D hexagonal torus topology
		(illustrated in figure \ref{fig:spinn-topology}) which, if laid out
		na\"ively, would require cables long enough to span the whole system. For
		the large machine in figure \ref{fig:spinnaker-abstractions}, this would be
		over 6 metres. Preliminary work has developed a tool to aid the design of
		alternative physical organisations of SpiNNaker machines (such as in the
		figure) which maintain the same logical connectivity but only use wires less
		than a metre long.
		
		Watts and Strogatz demonstrated that adding a small number of random links
		to a torus topology can convert it into a `small-world' network
		\cite{watts98}. An example of a small-world network is the human social
		network where the idea is popularly known as the theory of `six degrees of
		separation'. The theory states that any two people are connected by a chain
		of no more than six acquaintances. This property is also desirable in
		computer networks since it reduces the maximum and average number of `hops'
		messages must make when travelling through a network. This both reduces the
		latency of messages and also frees up resources on links \cite{shin11}. This
		freeing of resources enables the network to operate at lower speeds and thus
		lower power.
		
		Random links added to a network can easily require wires longer than a metre
		and allowing only short random connections was found to prevent small-world
		networks from forming. However, when systems were laid out to reduce wire
		lengths logically distant boards become physically close. This meant that
		even short cables could create logically long connections, once again
		allowing small-world networks to form.
	
	
	\subsection{High-speed serial (HSS)}
		
		Preliminary work has also resulted in the development of foundational
		hardware components for implementing new connectivity schemes within
		SpiNNaker's board-to-board interconnect. These components include a crossbar
		switch \cite{dally04} which allows spikes to be selectively redirected and
		interfaces for connecting links operating at different speeds.  These
		components will be built upon during upcoming work.
		
		A proof-of-concept demonstration system was produced which connects
		SpiNNaker to a host PC using spare HSS connections on SpiNNaker boards. This
		system replaces an existing Ethernet connection to SpiNNaker (out of the
		scope of this report) used for system management and interaction with neural
		models. Though the prototype link operates at a fraction of the maximum
		speed of an HSS link, it has achieved an order-of-magnitude improvement in
		host bandwidth for certain neural loads by bypassing bottlenecks in the
		Ethernet subsystem.


\section{Research plan}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\center
		\input{figures/plan-gantt}
		
		\caption{Research plan Gantt chart. Boxes indicate the expected duration of
		a task, thick lines indicate slack and red arrows show dependencies between
		tasks. Note the non-linear scale.}
		\label{fig:plan-gantt}
	\end{figure}
	
	An outline of planned research is given in figure \ref{fig:plan-gantt}. The
	major components of this plan are outlined in this section.
	
	\subsection{Benchmarking}
		
		To assess success, a suite of benchmarks is required. A method of
		automatically converting both models developed by neuroscientists and a
		number of synthetic tests for the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)
		\cite{eliasmith04} into benchmarks has been proposed. This approach ensures
		that the benchmarks will represent realistic neural loads while also
		allowing systematic experimentation and exploration of corner cases.
	
	\subsection{Small-world}
		
		Building on preliminary work, models of small-world configurations in
		SpiNNaker's network will be modelled and, if found to be effective,
		implementation will follow. It is hoped that the associated reduction in
		traffic will allow a global reduction in link speed. The most significant
		open problem to be solved is the determination of the complexity of routing
		strategy required to exploit small-world connections. Simpler designs may be
		insufficient for realistic systems but complex routers may consume more
		power than they save.
	
	\subsection{HSS power management}
		
		As described earlier, HSS systems present an energy efficiently challenge
		for neural loads due to their load-independent energy consumption and slow
		link speed changes. This work focuses on reducing the time HSS links are
		unavailable during link speed changes making it possible to change link
		speeds dynamically in response to changes in system load.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\center
			\input{figures/emergency-routing}
			
			\caption{Connectivity between boards (circles) in part of a SpiNNaker
			system. A link undergoing a speed change is avoided by traversing two
			neighbouring links.}
			\label{fig:emergency-routing}
		\end{figure}
		
		Two complementary approaches are being considered: the first involves
		transmitting data redundantly while a link is changing speed. During speed
		changes, the link becomes unreliable and existing systems simply wait until
		the link stabilises at the expense of latency to avoid adding additional
		hardware for this special case. By using forward Error Correction (FEC)
		\cite{hamming50} link errors can be corrected inexpensively using redundant
		encoding of data sent over the link.
		
		The second approach is to redirect data via an alternative route during link
		speed changes. This is possible due to redundancy inherent in the toroidal
		mesh topology of board-to-board links in SpiNNaker; while a link changes
		speeds, data can be redirected via two neighbouring links as shown in figure
		\ref{fig:emergency-routing}.
		
		Energy consumption will be measured during the execution of the benchmarks
		described above using power measurement techniques used in other SpiNNaker
		power usage studies \cite{sharp12,stromatias13}.


\section{Conclusions}
	
	Large scale neural simulations represent a rich opportunity for
	neuroscientists to understand the brain but progress has been  held back by
	their computational expense. While specialised architectures such as SpiNNaker
	have significantly advanced the state of the art, their interconnection
	networks are only beginning to adopt HSS interconnect technologies which enjoy
	heavy investment from the super computer industry \cite{infinibandta}.
	
	This work aims to develop a new generation of HSS-based networks for neural
	simulators which improve both system performance and power efficiency.
	Preliminary work has developed network modelling tools and proposed a novel
	technique which adds small-world connectivity to HSS networks, reducing both
	latency and network load. Planned work will implement this small-world
	connectivity scheme within SpiNNaker's HSS board-to-board interconnect and
	complement this with the development of an HSS power management scheme
	appropriate for neural systems.
